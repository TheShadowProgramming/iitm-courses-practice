# practice project description

- we'll try to create the frontEnd ui in react of this project, where the backend is in Django like we'll think about shifting the codebase to DJango eventually
- or maybe start some other project altogether with react + DJango
- remember docs is the best resource of flask and Django like applications

# Future add ons

- once you connect the database then think about how to remember the user through jwts sorts
- view password field or checkbox to view the password

- when someone clicks on the link below the blog then the user should be redirected towards the profile of the user who posted the blog post
- sidebar me tags and reading lists, and the user should only see the posts from the creators whom they're following 
- Use pagination or infinite scroll in Flask route
- Send AJAX requests for more data
