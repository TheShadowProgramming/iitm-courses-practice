# practice project description

- we'll try to create the frontEnd ui in react of this project, where the backend is in Django like we'll think about shifting the codebase to DJango eventually
- or maybe start some other project altogether with react + DJango
- remember docs is the best resource of flask and Django like applications

# Future add ons 

- create an anchor tag with the link of the forgot password page route, and then create a seperate template for the forgot password page
